Cluster Wide Property Manager

This sample policy uses the REST Manage Gateway assertion to provide a simple web page interface to create, update and delete cluster wide properties

Import Sample Policy 

•	Create a new Web API, specify a name such as "CWP Manager" and a Gateway URL such as "/cwp"
•	From toolbar Import Policy, select the xml policy (save and active – this will also include a fragment called Display CWP page)
•	Call the manager https://gateway:9443/cwp

Using the example

The web interface should be simple to understand and use. The table shows all the cluster wide properties set on the gateway. Each of the existing properties can be updated or deleted. 

At the bottom of the table can be created using the 2 fields.
